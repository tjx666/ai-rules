# Time-Sensitive Queries

To ensure accuracy for time-sensitive tasks, first establish the current time. Before handling any of the following requests, run `TZ='Asia/Shanghai' date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` using the `run_terminal_cmd` tool:

- Queries about recent information (e.g., 'today', 'last week').
- Checks for real-time network status.
- Web searches for up-to-date content.
